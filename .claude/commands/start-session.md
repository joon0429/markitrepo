I'm starting a new work session. Please:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** and summarize:
   - Current project priorities
   - Key design principles I should remember
   - Recent technical decisions
   - Any lessons learned / things to avoid

2. **Check recent changes** by looking at:
   - Git status and recent commits
   - Any TODO comments in the codebase

3. **Provide a brief status:**
   - Where we left off
   - Suggested next steps
   - Any blockers or decisions needed

Keep the summary concise (bullet points).

**ALL FUTURE WORK SHOULD REFER BACK TO THE CLAUDE.md FILE TO ENSURE WE DONT REPEAT MISTAKES OR REVERT PREVIOUS CHANGES**

If the user provided specific context with this command, prioritize saving that information.
