Review our current conversation and update the CLAUDE.md file with any new:

1. **Design decisions** - UI/UX patterns, interaction choices, visual design rules
2. **Technical decisions** - Architecture, libraries, code conventions
3. **Lessons learned** - Bugs fixed, mistakes to avoid, gotchas discovered
4. **Current context** - What we're working on, priorities, parking lot items

Instructions:
- Read the current CLAUDE.md file first
- Add new information to the appropriate sections
- **YOU DO NOT NEED TO UPDATE EVERY SECTION. ONLY APPROPRIATE AND MINIMAL CHANGES**
- Update the "Last updated" date at the top
- Use the existing table/list formats
- Do NOT remove existing content unless it's outdated
- If adding to "Lessons Learned" or "Technical Decisions" tables, include today's date
- Summarize what you added after updating
- **REVIEW ALL TOUCHPOINTS AND MAKE CONTEXTUAL EDITS FOR OUTDATED, MOOT, OR REDUNDANT INFORMATION**

If the user provided specific context with this command, prioritize saving that information.
